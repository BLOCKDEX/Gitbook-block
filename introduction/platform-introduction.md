# ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¾ Platform Introduction

BlockDx Exchange is a decentralized platform of blockchain developed by an anonymous development team. BlockDx's headquarters are established in the Cayman Islands, a British overseas territory in the Caribbean.

BlockDx transactions are based on the MATIC (Polygon) mainnet block heightâ€˜s hash (approximately 60 seconds, 30 blocks). B means the last digit of the block hash is a number from 0 to 4, and L means the last digit of the block hash is a number from 5 to 9. The +1% return or -1% loss of B or L selected by the user is immediately reflected.

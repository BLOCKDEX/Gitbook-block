# ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¾ Platform Introduction

BlockDx Exchange is a decentralized platform of blockchain developed by an anonymous development team. BlockDx's headquarters are established in the Cayman Islands, a British overseas territory in the Caribbean.

BlockDx transactions are based on the Binance Smart Chain mainnet block heightâ€˜s hash (approximately 60 seconds, 20 blocks). B means the last digit of the block hash is a number from 0 to 4, and L means the last digit of the block hash is a number from 5 to 9. All transactions are immediately reflected by the smart contract.

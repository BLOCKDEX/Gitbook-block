# Why Binance Smart Chain?

MBNB Smart Chain (BSC) is best described as a blockchain that runs in parallel to the BNB Beacon Chain. Unlike BNB Beacon Chain, BSC boasts smart contract functionality and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The design goal here was to leave the high throughput of BNB Beacon Chain intact while introducing smart contracts into its ecosystem.

In essence, both blockchains operate side-by-side. It’s worth noting that BSC isn’t a so-called layer two or off-chain scalability solution. It’s an independent blockchain that could run even if BNB Beacon Chain went offline. That said, both chains bear a strong resemblance from a design standpoint.

Because BSC is EVM-compatible, it launched with support for the rich universe of Ethereum tools and DApps. In theory, this makes it easy for developers to port their projects over from Ethereum. For users, it means that applications like MetaMask/TokenPocket can be easily configured to work with BSC.

1\. Technically, it has the advantages of decentralization, anonymity, traceability and immutable blockchain.

2\. One of the main advantages of Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is that smart contracts support high throughput and low latency.

3\. One of the main advantages of Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is the ability to process transactions for users at lightning speed, but it is highly centralized in a way.

4\. Achieve the highest level of security and efficiency and achieve ultra-low gas fees

5\. Binance Smart Chain is a new blockchain with a mature environment for developing high-performance decentralized applications

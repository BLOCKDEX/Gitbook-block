<summary>What is a BNB Smart Chain?</summary>

BNB Smart Chain (BSC) is best described as a blockchain that runs in parallel to the BNB Beacon Chain. Unlike BNB Beacon Chain, BSC boasts smart contract functionality and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The design goal here was to leave the high throughput of BNB Beacon Chain intact while introducing smart contracts into its ecosystem.

In essence, both blockchains operate side-by-side. It’s worth noting that BSC isn’t a so-called layer two or off-chain scalability solution. It’s an independent blockchain that could run even if BNB Beacon Chain went offline. That said, both chains bear a strong resemblance from a design standpoint.

Because BSC is EVM-compatible, it launched with support for the rich universe of Ethereum tools and DApps. In theory, this makes it easy for developers to port their projects over from Ethereum. For users, it means that applications like MetaMask can be easily configured to work with BSC. Seriously – it’s just a matter of tweaking a couple of settings. Check out Use MetaMask for BNB Smart Chain to get started.

<summary>What is the Block Hash?</summary>

The blockhash is a value obtained by converting information such as the root hash that encrypts the transaction history in a specific block, the hash value of the previous block, and the nonce back into a hash. In the blockchain, a device that makes forgery of data more difficult is the hash.

<summary>Guide for using the exchange?</summary>



1. BlockDx futures trading is a transaction that takes about 60 seconds and 20 blocks (applies block 1 to 18 transactions, applies next transactions in blocks 19 to 20, and applies the result of block 20 data) based on the BNB Smart Chain. The hash value of the block of the exchange is created as a combination of English letters and numbers as an investment object. Investors can invest in B mode when the last digits of the hash value from 0 to 4 are expected, and in L mode when 5 to 9 are expected.
2. BlockDx limit B/L mode transactions (specified number of B - specified number of L) are manually liquidated with profit or loss according to the set number of times and the smart contract is automatically terminated at the set value.
3. BlockDx leveraged trades are x1: ±1%, x5: ±5%, x10: ±10%, x15: ±15%, x20: ±20%. Fees are 0.1% for trades with selected leverage and 0.2% for limit trades.
4. BLDX token transaction mining is 0.02% of the market and 0.01% of the limit.
